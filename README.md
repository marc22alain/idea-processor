# idea-processor

The **idea-processor** is an experiment in improving the experience of writing. Since the point of writing is to (usually) express ideas, this app aims to shift one's focus from manipulating text to the development and manipulation of ideas.

Starting from the observation that writing generally follows a process of developing ideas from the general to the specific, the **idea-processor** creates a tree structure for the expression of ideas. The root idea will be the most general idea, concept, or impulse for the document. The leaves of the tree are the sentences and paragraphs that will be collated to form the finished document. Everything in between is the record of iterative development of the ideas that form the whole.

Currently, the **idea-processor** also supports hiding ideas, re-ordering of ideas, and shifting ideas to different branches. Branches can be displayed in order of most recently modified.

Features in conception and development include: creating views that de-emphasize the ideas that are not being developed; providing a variety of algorithms to prompt new ideas; a view that renders a finished document from the leaves of the idea tree.

Prompting for new ideas will use keywords defined by the user, words and ideas found in other ideas already created, keywords pulled from research papers provided by the user, keywords pulled from document templates such as resumes, keywords pulled from documents to respond to such as job ads. The prompts should be formulated as questions, and ideas written in response would include a reference to the prompting question.

Don't be fooled, this app is off-line only. All data that put into the app is saved locally by your web browser.<br>
This entrains a few novel features:
* the data that you input with one browser will not be available to any other browser
* if you delete your browsing history, you will delete the data that you've put in; if you are using Chrome, you have the ability to selectively delete browsing history, by web site
* you will have access to your data, and be able to continue using the app, even if you are offline

Backing up your browser's data is a great idea!

The app is really rough at the moment. If there is anything you find that needs fixing, you are welcome to report that by creating an [issue](https://github.com/marc22alain/idea-processor/issues). Thank you for your help!
