Idea Processor

Address immediately, for distribution:
- manifest.appcache
- nodes now save text only when they lose focus
  . highlight the textarea when it's changed, hinting that it isn't saved yet

Deploy with `npm run deploy`
- issue with path of rootURL (config/environment.js)
  . local `-prod` requires '/'
  . gh-pages `-prod` requires 'idea-processor/'

Bugs
- if clicking off a node also turns it into a non-leaf, then the size estimation is short
- deleting a parent node leaves its children in the DB
- recompiling of computedText does not flow all the way up the chain
  .or at least, not consistently
- deleted nodes don't stay deleted (!?)
  .but their data is destroyed (?!)


Features
- rendering of final document
- re-ordering of nodes
  .sort the children in the list
- make the text expand/shrink checkbox appear only when there is more text than can be shown.

App error logging, to help debug the IndexedDB issue and others
- set up an error-logging server
  . Node + Express
- set up and endpoint
  . or custom ?
- make it a database
  . MongoDB ?
  . what's lightweight ? it has to run as a separate service
  . indexable text
  . with particular app and version, as source
- apps have the logging service, as an add-on (eventually) that can be slotted into any JS code base (not just an Ember app)
  . Ember service should also be lightweight, and use its own libraries for POSTing log data
    .. in the event of a failed POST, should raise an immediate alarm

USAGE:
- had a quite urge to provide templating for common idea formats, or tasks
  . e.g. "Screening" task for resumes

Done
- √ FEATURE: when making a new node, focus shifts to that node
  .use element.focus() in component.didInsertElement()
- FEATURE: page structure:
  √ .index holds all root nodes (independent documents)
  √ .computed routes makes a new URL for each root node (document)
- √ FEATURE: rendering of node text (from children)
  .do I keep the meta text ? how to display it ?
- √ FEATURE: drag-'n-drop nodes to assign to new parents
- √ BUG: more effective watching of child nodes
  .although seems to working when watching 'model.childnode.length'
- √ FEATURE: icons for drag-'n-drop
- √ FEATURE: icons expanding / contracting children, with down / up arrows
- √ BUG: lost the focus() to newly created nodes (CSS selector changed)

Observations:
- there are still lots of distractions on the page

Bugs:
- ! Safari closed the IndexedDB, and deleted it!
