Bugs
- deleting a parent node leaves its children in the DB
- recompiling of computedText does not flow all the way up the chain
  .or at least, not consistently
- deleted nodes don't stay deleted (!?)
- lost the focus() to newly created nodes


Features
- rendering of final document
- icons expanding / contracting children, with down / up arrows
- icons for drag-'n-drop
- re-ordering of nodes
  .sort the children in the list


Done
- √ when making a new node, focus shifts to that node
  .use element.focus() in component.didInsertElement()
- page structure:
  √ .index holds all root nodes (independent documents)
  √ .computed routes makes a new URL for each root node (document)
- √ rendering of node text (from children)
  .do I keep the meta text ? how to display it ?
- √ drag-'n-drop nodes to assign to new parents
- √ more effective watching of child nodes
  .although seems to working when watching 'model.childnode.length'
